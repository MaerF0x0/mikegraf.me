# Welcome and Happy Birthday! ðŸŽ‰

I recently saw that [Hugo is turning 5](https://gohugo.io/news/lets-celebrate-hugos-5th-birthday/). 
I first heard of Hugo a few years back while I worked at [Clever](https://clever.com).
I hummed and hawed a bit about making my own blog + website but never really got
around to it. That is until today! As a sort of impetous to action and to help 
wish them well I decided to launch mikegraf.me using hugo on their birthday!
